## How to run a local project in a docker container.

### Goal

A local (on host) project

- of certain facets: python (pip), flask
- without support on the host (no python, flask, pip and python code extensions)
- needs to be run in a docker container
- having all the required skd, tools, code extensions installed in container and visual studio code
- and remotely being able to run/debug project in the container.
